    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I am a Fullstack JavaScript Developer working with a modern stack including Next.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL. I graduated from Attractor School Almaty, where I gained hands-on experience in building full-cycle web applications.I also completed my degree at Almaty University of Power Engineering and Telecommunications with a specialization in Automation and Control. My engineering background provided me with a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and experience with the LAD language, which helps me design structured and reliable solutions in software development."
